Movie recommendation systems are becoming increasingly popular as users seek personalized and relevant movie recommendations. One common approach to movie recommendation is using cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movies based on their attributes. This report provides a detailed overview of a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity, including data collection, preprocessing, vector conversion, creating movie profiles, user profiling, similarity score calculation, recommendation, evaluation, and refinement. The report also includes a litera- ture survey on movie recommendation systems and their various approaches. The proposed system aims to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations to enhance user experience and increase user engagement in movie streaming services. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing relevant and personalized movie recommendations to users.


Our recommending system uses cosine similarity which is a type of content-based filtering method to recommend similar movies to the user. Additional information about the searched movie will also be provided. The additional information includes Language of the movie, an Overview of the movie, a Rating of the movie, Genres, the Run time of the movie, and its status which can either be released or unreleased.


The proposed solution mainly uses python to work on data sets and to apply various Machine Learning algorithms to get the desired output.


In conclusion, we have presented a movie recommendation system that uses cosine similarity to rec- ommend movies to users. The proposed system outperformed other movie recommendation systems in terms of accuracy and personalization. The system’s performance can be further improved by incor- porating more movie attributes and using more advanced machine learning techniques. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to enhance user experience and increase user engagement in movie streaming services.
When the user searches for a movie that he/she has already watched the Movies Recommendation System will recommend the top ten movies that are most similar to the searched movie. Moreover, the system will show additional details of the movie.All these features will save user’s time which otherwise would have been wasted on finding a movie that he/she may or may not like.
